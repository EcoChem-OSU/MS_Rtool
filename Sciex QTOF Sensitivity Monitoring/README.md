Sciex 7600 QTOF Sensitivity Monitoring CODE to continually monitor the sensitivity (absolute intensity for standards) across the FIELD lab (OSU) daily instrument running and make a cleaning decision in time when the sensitivity drops clearly
---------------------------------------
Description
-----------
For all the target and internal standards PFAS, separately visualize their absolute response (Area) changes over time as different batch progress on and on...
The script input would be the Area file exported from Sciex OS using the Quantification results with analysis date as the file name prefix and the out put will be a series of plots for the standards response change over time and a summary table for the area data. 

> [!NOTE]
> ** READ CAREFULLY THE DOCUMENTATION ON THE SCRIPT**
